Gave Bug Catcher Petrus's Butterfree Shield Dust and Focus Sash (was Tinted Lens and Heavy-Duty Boots but Shield Dust blocks hazard damage in this game too)

Fixed a typo in the word "suppress" in Core Enforcer's description
Fixed Heal Pulse's description for consistency

Added Frost Orb (Kleine Village area), has Frostbite equivalent effect as Flame Orb, and gave to a bunch of trainers instead of Flame Orb for Guts mons
(since Frostbite is technically better than Burn in case you lose your ability)
Fixed a cave tile in Icy Path
ADDED A NUZLOCKE MODE (can activate by creating a new save -> checking the Nuzlocke Mode checkbox on the Welcome Menu):
- Enforced encounters: the game keeps track of which places you've got an encounter at and won't let you catch anything past the first Pokemon you see
- Dupes Clause: the game will not count the first encounter as your encounter if you've already registered a member of its evolutionary family
- Gift Encounters: a gift counts for your encounter in that area - won't let you recieve the gift if you've already gotten an encounter in that area
- Eggs: an egg counts as encounter in the area you hatch it in, it won't hatch in that area if you've already gotten an encounter in that area
- Permadeath: Fainting will never let that Pokemon become unfainted unless you use a revive which will invalidate your save file's nuzlocke (see below)
- Nuzlocke Invalidation: wiping, using a revive, save scumming, as well as some secret mechanisms will mark your save file as invalid so I can evaluate it if you're trying to get your own NPC
- Nuzlocke Starting: the nuzlocke rules won't start until you get Pokeballs
- Enforced Level Caps: the game knows your current level cap and won't let you enter a fight if you have an overleveled Pokemon in your team
- Overleveling: if you overlevel in a fight, the game will make you switch it out if you can, won't let you switch it in, but if it's your last mon you will wipe
- Nuzlocke info: a Nuzlocke Info button has been added to the player screen which shows your list of encounters, whether or not your nuzlocke is valid
- Level Cap display: the current level cap is displayed in your player card as well. the NEXT level cap applies as soon as you TALK to the current gym leader
Fixed tile snapping for Rock Climbing
Fixed a bug with foe getting reassigned twice, meaning that it's like it never switched which is bad
Made starting a Nuzlocke automatically give you the following QOL items:
- Infinite Repel: toggles repel on/off
- Healing Pack: heals your team to full (doesn't work in gauntlets/before you get access to Map Teleport)
- Pocket PC: lets you access the PC from anywhere ('')
- Rare Candy Box: infinite rare candies essentially
- Edge Kit: leaves your Pokemon at 1 xp to leveling up (to use before Gym Fights)
- Status Kit: inflicts a status of your choosing on the Pokemon (provided it effects them)
- Damage Kit: subtracts 1 HP from the Pokemon (won't go < 1)
Tweaked Professor and Photon's dex checking dialogue to say "caught" instead of "seen" to reflect that they're looking for caught Pokemon not seen
Fixed using Elixir resetting your move selected index
Updated Synchronize's description to say that it also passes a frostbite since it does
Fixed Trick Room/Magic Room having opposite messages when they end
Fixed Fusion Bolt/Fusion Flare not updating the last used move

Fixed a typo in the evo strings "Torrged" -> "Torgged"
CREATED AN EXCEL FORMAT TRAINER DOCUMENTATION GENERATOR: JUST USE THE Trainers[] checkbox on the Welcome Menu!
Buffed Wormbot and Wormatron's weight to accurately represent the new sprites (100.6 -> 163.6, 185.3 -> 245.3 respectively)
Fixed Assault Vest not applying if you got crit (probably need to rework how crits are handled in the future)
Fixed Froshrog's evo level showing 32 even though it's actually 31
Fixed Scovillains both showing they evolve into "Kerbenero" instead of "Despenero"
Made Hammo 15% -> 13%, Teddull 15% -> 14%, and Seviper 7% -> 10% on Route 25
Made Sapwin 16% -> 15%, Sedinister 11% -> 8%, Ralts 10% -> 9%, and added Benglow (5%) to Route 26
New sprites for Twigzap, Shockbranch and Thunderzap!
Added Egg Groups, assigned fitting Egg Groups to each Pokemon, and added in a Nursery in Iron Town (8th gym split)!
Nursery mechanics are a bit different in this game due to there not being genders for Pokemon, so here's how everything works as of now:
- If any 2 Pokemon in the nursery share at least 1 egg group, they're compatible, unless either is in the UNDISCOVERED Egg Group.
- If 2 Pokemon are compatible, there's a 25% chance every 256 frames (50% if both Pokemon are from the same evolution family) that an egg is made
- The species is a coin flip between the two unless 1 is holding Destiny Knot - in which case that one will be the "parent" (Egg will be same species)
- Egg's ability is 80% selected parent's if it's a regular ability, or 60% hidden ability, 20% another ability slot if the parent has its hidden ability
- Nature is random unless one of the parents are holding an everstone, in which case the Egg will have that nature
- IVs are either 3 passed down picked from either parent, or 5 passed down if one is holding Destiny Knot
- Whichever parent is selected will pass down its ball to the egg as well
- Egg cycles that it takes to hatch are now a formula based inversely on its final stage's catch rate - basically, the rarer the Pokemon, the longer it takes to hatch!
Made Draco Meteor cost $10000 instead of $2000
Made debug task function (holding Ctrl + Shift will print to the console) also print the game state in int form
Buffed Poison Gas accuracy to be 90% to match the vanilla buff
Changed Shedinja's catch rate to be 45 instead of 5 (idk why it was ever 5 in my game, oops)
Did some fancy bidirectional mapping and breadth-first search to get the evolution family, baby stage and final stage of any given Pokemon
This has some weird implications (like Caterpie not being connected to regular Metapod and Butterfree since Caterpie evolves into Metapod-X, and Shedinja being its own thing not really connected to Nincada) but it's fine
Made the shiny exclusive move (can't be retaught) coloring also apply to moves that the Pokemon learns but doesn't have in the level-up moveset yet (like getting it earlier from a pre-evo)
Made Photon giving you Map Teleport also have some extra dialogue if you're nuzlocking to tell the player that their Pocket PC and Healing Pack are online
Gave Scraggy Headbutt at lv 31 and Scrafty at lv 42 to help make it easier to evolve

Fixed Hammer Arm not being a Punching move
Gave Pterator Roost at lv 70
Made Elelamb line compatible with Rock Polish TM
Removed the left-facing ledge on Route 22 next to New Minnow Town since apparently new players don't realize they can go that way
Made the guard to Route 40 in the gate say "swear to Arceus" instead of "swear to god"
Made saving the game save your saves in your AppData folder to help the issue of not having permission to save in certain systems
Also makes it work easier with the .exe installer I made
Made docs generate in your Documents folder on your PC and auto-open the folder whenever any new docs are created so you can find them easier
Made screenshots go into your Documents folder as well instead of the same directory as where the game is
Changed screenshots file naming to be Date_Time instead of System Milliseconds when the screenshot was captured
Changed King's Rock, Shed Shell, Muscle Band and Wise Glasses to all sell for $0 since when they had a price they were sellable in the bag, which isn't intended since I previously made all only-1-of held items unsellable
Made opening the calc with no Pokemon (the player doesn't even have the calc yet) not crash the game - will eventually remove the tooltip before you have calc too
Gave Cervora Magic Reflect at lv 37
Gave Swimmer Anita's, Magician Monika's, Magician Yolanda's Cervora's Magic Reflect in their movesets
Made Star Trade NPC, all other NPCs if not already overwritten, and static encounters use UI.MAX_TEXTBOX instead of an arbitrary number

Added Weight, Catch Rate, Egg Cycles, and Egg Groups in a table for each Pokemon in the PokemonInfo doc!

Changed Gentleman Dennis's Starmie's Recover -> Abduct
Changed Hiker Stacy's Azumarill's Quick Attack -> Extreme Speed
Made Trainer AI know that moves with positive Primary Effects (Knock Off, Dragon Tail, etc) should be treated as status moves
Made Eject Button "cancel" Pivoting moves to match vanilla mechanics
Made falling asleep from Yawn announce if it failed, blocked by Psychic typing, etc
Fixed how AI sees ground immunity by recognizing if a Pokemon is ungrounded or not, instead of just Levitate and Air Balloon (to work with magnet rise, smack down, gravity and such)
Added "Open Location" under the Manage button on the startup menu to open the location of a save file to help the player find it easier
Fixed Magic Bounce not being able to bounce back status moves that are used on themselves (from Magic Reflect/Abduct)
Buffed Magnet Rise to permanently levitate you (via a status effect) until you switch out instead of a counter
Changed Knock Off's move description to make its effect and damage boost more clear
Redid how crits are handled/calculated to work with a ton of niche cases like Psyshock, Foul Play, Body Press, etc. and for scalability
Made Rare Candies sellable for $600 (instead of $0) since nuzlockers now have a key item for Rare Candies and not just 999x Rare Candy item
Fixed AI knowing which move Kissyfishy-D is using (replaced base moves with the -D moves in the AI)
Gave Osceloma Nasty Plot at lv 54 and moved Psychic Terrain and Energy Ball back a bit to make room
Gave Zoroark Frostbind at lv 68
Gave Hast-E Rising Voltage at lv 60
Gave Sedisoftra-E Diamond Storm at lv 60 and moved Fire Blast to lv 58 to buff its viability a bit and make it closer to Prismodon-E viability
Gave Diamond Storm to Glimmora at lv 60
Gave Psycorboratr Body Slam via TM
Fixed a critical game-crashing Burn Up bug with a Pokemon being Fire secondary typing (only applies to Scovillain/Despenero but it's fixed)
Gave Lagma line Scald via TM since they already get Surf and Whirlpool
Gave Fireblion Earthquake via TM since it already gets Drill Run by level up
Fixed multiple Pokemon not being able to evolve on the same exp yield (1 Pokemon still can't evolve 2 different times from the same exp yield - this is intentional)
Added checking for duplicate moves in a moveset to the moveset validator
Made entering a cutscene reset your sprite
Changed a bunch of "..?" to "...?" for consistency and proper syntax
Fixed bug with Dex Nav window width being calculated slightly incorrectly
Added pressing 'D' when hovering a Pokeball will show the ball's info and the catch change in % for the wild Pokemon you're fighting!
Changed Love Ball to be same family: catch multiplier = 8, in compatible egg groups: catch mul = 4, otherwise just 1 instead of just checking if they're the same ID
Added new sprites for Sheltor, Shelnado, Rhypo, Rhynee, Rhypolar
Revamped Casino Coin held items to scale with your gym badges - meaning only certain items are available for purchase with more being available after each gym badge
Fixed bug with Evolution text (<Pokemon> evolved into <New Species>!) and how it interacted with text that's supposed to show for learning a move
Finally fixed the other Choice Item (the one you didn't pick in Sicab City tower) showing up correctly in Power Plant (pt.2)
Fixed an Adrenaline Orb in Shadow Ravine -1A being on the same tile as the Slow Fall pit destination
Fixed user/foe party to show the active Pokemon relative to what slot they are on your team (as opposed to always showing the first Pokemon in the line is active)
Fixed a bug with Breeder lady in Glurg Town and one dialogue not having her nametag
Removed the fishing boolean flag from the player class since it's a fully functional item now
Added a buffer for Silhouette sprites so they only need to be loaded once to make Dex Nav less laggy
Fixed a bug with deleting a save file not showing the new save file that's selected's team and location and last date modified
Fixed Arcane Spell effect sometimes actually buffing a move's base power to the "minimum cap" of 20 BP (weak Eruption, multi-hit moves that are below 20 BP per hit, etc)
Fixed checking if the trainer's Pokemon is a dupe for efficiency sake (unneccesary check)
Fixed evolving your lead Pokemon that is not active anymore overwriting your active Pokemon's displayed HP and max HP (purely visual bug)
Fixed a crucial bug with the Pokemon's exp points going into the negative after levelling up (recalculated exp too many times)
Made Destiny Bond effect go on the user, not the target (since it targets itself anyways)
Fixed Flinching being able to be applied more than once due to King's rock and the move also being able to flinch
Added the following flags to the move summary UI(s):
- Makes Contact
- Priority Stage
- Crit Stage
- Slicing Move (Sharpness)
- Punching Move (Iron Fist and Punching Glove)
- Tail Move (Sharp Tail)
- No Combo Move (meaning other moves or this move with this flag can't be used in succession with itself)
- Sound Move (Throat Chop and Throat Spray)
- Biting Move (Strong Jaw)
- Healing Move (gets blocked by Heal Block effect)
Reorganized and redesigned the move summary UI a bit to fit this info in a reasonable space (had to make the UI a little taller vertically but not too bad)
Resized some UIs that relied on the move summary UI being a specific size, namely:
- Pokedex moves summary
- Learning a move (both hovering the move to learn and the move to forget)
- Move reminder (also made the scroll pane taller/fit an extra move at once and now allows for holding [Ctrl] while scrolling to scroll 5x at once)
- In battle (by pressing 'D')
- Pokemon's summary
- Info for TMs in bag
Changed the second Wiki Berry tree (on Route 43, need Surf) to be a second Sitrus Berry tree
Made Font Size scale in the selecting move screen in battle for long move names (FINALLY!)
Fixed PP Max's description saying it increases a move by 160% to just 60% which is less confusing since PP Up says increases by 20%

Fixed Bug Catcher Maude giving $200 instead of $100
Added what slot the Pokemon is in when you're looking at its summary in either your party or viewing the foe's party (for identical eggs differention)
Changed having a status effect (Burn, Poison, etc.) in your party view making the background the color of the status instead of always yellow for all of them
Tweaked the colors of Burn, Paralysis, Poison, and Toxic Poison due to above (also made Poison and Toxic Poison have a slightly different shade of purple)
Fixed some minor formatting with where the status icon is in the Pokemon's summary view if they have one
Changed dialogue for the gift -E/-S NPC in Frenco City and the Breeder that gives you a gift egg in Glurg Town to make it WAY better and more interesting
Changed the gift egg that the aformentioned Breeder gives you to be [Minishoo/Zorua (or if you have either, guaranteed Flamehox)] -> to be one of randomly: [Zorua, Flamehox, Scraggy, Solosis-X, Seviper, Gulpin-X, Azurill] since Minishoo is already a gift elsewhere and to give it more variety
Revamped the fossil NPC in Glurg Town to have way more interesting dialogue and to give you an Egg of the fossil ONLY ON NUZLOCKE MODE so you can potentially get both fossils guaranteed by hatching them in different locations!
ADDED CUSTOM ITEM SORTING IN YOUR BAG POCKETS WITH A BUNCH OF PRESET SORTING MECHANISMS FOR YOU TO PICK FROM ([Ctrl] + [A]!), NAMELY:
- Alphabetical (any pocket)
- Reverse Alphabetical (any pocket)
- Count (high -> low) (any pocket but TMs and Key Items)
- Sell Price (high -> low) (any pocket but TMs and Key Items)
- Default (the order in which i picked that every save defaults to) (any pocket)
- Move type alphabetically (TMs only)
- Move Base Power (high -> low) (TMs only)
- Move Category (Phys -> Spec -> Stat) (TMs only)
- Move Accuracy (high -> low) (TMs only)
- Move Priority (high -> low) (TMs only)

Made Healing Circle not clickable by AI if the user doesn't have any valid team members left
Fixed Jaboca Berry and Kee Berry still printing that they activated if the holder fainted when they activated
Fixed bug with trapping effects not being removed from yourself when you use a phazing move on the opponent (if you're wrapped and you Dragon Tail out the wrapper, for example, used to not remove the wrap effect from you)
Made Tailwind show the effective speed stat of the affected Pokemon in the Calculator
Added Unerodible ability as something for the AI to consider when checking for resists in the back since Superchargo is technically a Ground resist with it (should've had it in there from the start anyways)
Removed the move that you're trying to learn name in the header since the move is literally right below that, so I formatted the header to all fit on one line just saying "<Pokemon> wants to learn:"
Fixed TM58 Dragon Pulse location in Item Info doc
Moved TM95 Trick Room from the Frenco City shop to Abandoned Tower (8th gym split) since Ice Beam is only in the Deep Chasm, to mirror

Fixed the tooltips showing that you can press [Ctrl] + [A] for calc before you have a Pokemon
Made getting items after a battle support plurals ("You got 3 Fable Charges!")

Changed Lady Serapha's Butterfree's Quiver Dance -> Sticky Web
Added a statused icon for the team icons in the Battle UI (a darker red Pokeball)

Added overworld sprites for Glacius, Ryder, Mindy, Rayna and Merlin
Fixed a very crucial (and complicated) bug with the calc settings where enabling Reflect/Light Screen/Aurora Glow actually sets the effect on that side
Made Covert Cloak block the flinch chance from King's Rock
Changed getting Poisoned/Toxic Poisoned from TSpikes not know who is on the other side (so corrosion can't activate if the foe has it when you get poisoned from TSpikes)
Reworked Cloud Nine to block weather from going up while in, as well as its previous effect of resetting weather on switch-in
Gave Flamigo Swords Dance at 55 and Reversal at 60, moved Throat Chop and Brave Bird down a bit to compensate
Gave Athlete Gutierre's Flamigo Reversal and Endure instead of Close Combat and Facade

New sprites for Magie and Cumin!

Fixed Gallade's speed being 80 (NOT 63 - OOPS)
Fixed flag for stopping player from teleporting in Kleine Village being the incorrect one
Added "Reduces user's weight by 220 lbs" to Autotomize's description
Moved Metronome/Mirror Move/Mimic above the charging move check so it can properly call a charging move like Solar Beam and not just use it immediately
Changed Sedisoftra's Hidden Ability Solid Rock -> Sand Stream
Changed Prismodon's Hidden Ability Mirror Armor -> Sand Stream
Changed Lutrineer's Hidden Ability Hydration -> Drizzle
Changed Swimmer Dionne's Lutrineer's Swift Swim -> Drizzle and her Spinaquata's Drizzle, Damp Rock and Hurricane to Lightning Rod, Enigma Berry and Sludge Bomb respectively
Changed Hiker Iisakki's Sedisoftra's Sturdy and Weakness Policy to Sand Stream and Smooth Rock
Changed Hiker Peyton's Prismodon's Sturdy to Sand Stream

Gave Thunderzap Strength Sap at lv 1
Moved Nincada to Gelb Forest 2A instead of 1A and rebalanced some percentages to account for this
Changed Swalot-X's Hidden Ability Simple -> Cloud Nine
Reworked battle betting to add a bit of Gaussian (bell curve) randomness to both the odds and parlay lines to make it not just the exact (rounded) averages
Changed Swimmer Frey's Swalot-X's Simple/Weakness Policy -> Cloud Nine/Black Sludge
Revamped Blackjack by adding actual Blackjack 3:2 payouts, insurance for when dealer shows an ace, and a bet spinner to place bets with an arrow key
Added blackjack stats for the following:
- # Insurance Offered
- Insurance Take Rate
- Insurance Win Rate
- # Insurance Times Declined
- % of Missed Blackjack Opportunities
- % of Correct Declines
- # of Insurances won
- Amt of Insurance Profit
Added some text to the blackjack UI table showcasing payout info and bet info
Changed the min bet for everything to be 10 coins to have more accurate payouts for both battle betting and blackjack
Rebalanced gift coins and everything to account for coins being worth 10x less essentially (now start with 100 coins instead of 10 etc)
Also made coins sell for twice as much technically (since 10 coins = 1 old coin, and 1 old coin sold for 50 but 1 new coin sells for 10)

Made Hoghoncho way heavier than it currently is (205 -> 785 lbs)

Fixed incorrect flag in place for a locked door in Schrice City School

Finally made Wrap/Bind/etc say the correct effect name when getting hurt at the end of each turn (i.e. ___ was hurt by the fiery vortex!)

Reworked how Magic Room works in the backend so there's not weird visual bugs with Repels being held items for Pokemon in the calc
REDID HOW THE **ENTIRE** TRAINER AI WORKS TO NOW USE A SCORING SYSTEM FOR BOTH SWITCHING OUT, SWITCHING IN, AND MOVE SELECTION. THERE IS SO MANY CHANGES THAT IT WOULD BE HELL TO COVER HERE, SO I WILL ATTACH A DOCUMENT THAT YOU CAN ALSO CREATE WHEN GENERATING `Trainer doc` in game!

Fixed Poison Gas making contact (oops)

Fixed Protean not activating before the Protect check, so the type wouldn't change if the foe Protected

Gave Lafloo Stealth Rock at lv 65 and redistributed surrounding moves a bit
Changed Athlete Gutierre's Lafloo's Rock Polish -> Stealth Rock
Fixed the Technician check before all other BP multipliers (so a move like Incinerate will get the Technician boost before the Charcoal boost, so it'll be 108 BP instead of 72 BP previously (60 * 1.5 * 1.2))
