Bird Keeper (Flying)
Before

"Flying high is all I know. Are you ready to fall?"
"My Pokemon soar through the skies... and soon, so will my victory!"
"You can't catch my birds, and you won't catch a win either!"
"Feel the wind? It's blowing in my favor!"
"Let's see if you can keep up with my high-flying team!"
"I train my birds to be fast and fierce... just like me!"
After

"You grounded me... but I'll be back in the skies soon!"
"Even a bird has to land sometimes... I'll fly higher next time."
"You clipped my wings, but I'll soar again."
"That loss was like a gust of wind knocking me down..."
"I guess I'll have to go back to the nest and train harder!"

"You're tougher than a Caterpie. I'll give you that."
"Looks like I need to evolve too..."
"Squashed me, huh? Next time, I'll sting harder!"
"I may have lost, but bugs always come back."

Picnicker (Bug/Grass)
Before

"The sun's shining, the bugs are buzzing... and you're about to lose!"
""
"You better not trample the flowers... or my Pokemon!"
"Don't underestimate me just because I'm relaxing!"
After

""

"You think you can handle the waves? Let's find out!"
"It's surf time! Let's hang ten... over your defeat!"
"I'm as smooth as the sea. Try to keep up!"
After

"Wiped out, huh? Well, that's the life of a surfer!"
"Guess I'll be hitting the waves instead of winning today."

"Prepare for an expedition into icy defeat!"
After

""
""
"You're tougher than the frostbite I've faced... I respect that."
"I'll be better prepared for the next expedition."

Magician (M) (Magic)
Before

""
"I'll make your victory... disappear!"
"This battle is going to be magic. Too bad you're not prepared for it."
"Watch closely... or you'll miss the moment your chances vanish!"
"Prepare to be amazed... as I pull a win out of thin air!"
After

""
"The magic didn't work this time, but next time, I'll be the master of illusions!"
"You're good... but I'll conjure a victory eventually."
"Looks like my sleight of hand wasn't enough this time."
"The show's not over yet... I'll be back with something better."

Magician (F) (Magic)

After

""
"You've won this time, but the cosmos never stays the same for long."
"I'll recalibrate my strategy... and the stars will guide me to victory."
"You've navigated the stars well... but I'll see you again in the cosmos."
