Ace Trainer (Mixed/Dragon)
Before

"My skills are legendary. Let's see if you can keep up."
"Dragons bow to no one. You'll understand soon enough."
"You might think you stand a chance... but that's a fantasy."
"I've trained for years—are you prepared to be humbled?"
"Strength isn't just power, it's knowing when to strike."
After

"Looks like you've earned some respect... for now."
"Even the best fall. I'll rise again."
"Guess dragons aren't invincible after all. This time."
"A solid victory. You've earned this one."
"I underestimated you. Won't happen again."

Actor (Light/Normal)
Before

"Lights, camera, battle! I'll be the star of this scene!"
"Acting's all about deception. Are you ready for a plot twist?"
"Let's see if you can handle the spotlight!"
"I don't break character—even when I'm breaking you!"
"My performance is flawless—just like this battle will be."
After

"That wasn't in the script… but I'll take the loss."
"Bravo! You've outperformed me this time."
"This scene's not over yet. I'll be back for a sequel."
"Guess this wasn't my shining moment."
"Well, you've won this act. Enjoy the applause while it lasts."

Actress (Light/Normal)
Before

"Watch and learn. I'm about to steal the show!"
"Prepare for a performance you'll never forget."
"Don't think I'll go easy on you just because I'm in the spotlight."
"It's time for the grand finale. Too bad it'll be your defeat."
"Get ready for a dazzling display of skill!"
After

"No worries, darling, I'll be back for the encore."
"You think you've won the role? We'll see about that."
"Even stars lose sometimes... but I'll rise again."
"I may have lost, but my spotlight never dims."
"A tragic ending... but every story has one."

Athlete (Fire/Electric)
Before

"You better be quick if you wanna keep up with me!"
"Let's see if your endurance matches your strategy."
"Speed and power are all that matter here!"
"I'm always in top shape. Can you say the same?"
"Time to light this battle up! You ready?"
After

"Alright, you've got game. I respect that."
"Looks like I need to step up my training."
"Pushed me to the limit there. I'll get you next time."
"Not bad... but this athlete never stays down for long."
"I'll hit the track and come back even stronger."

Hiker (Ground/Rock/Steel)
Before

"Bet you're not ready for the weight of this battle."
"Mountains don't move, and neither will I."
"Tread lightly, or the ground will swallow you whole!"
"I've seen rough terrain, but nothing rougher than what's coming for you."
"Strength isn't just in your fists, it's in your foundation."
After

"Even mountains can be climbed, I guess."
"A tough fight, but I'll bounce back."
"Seems like you've found your footing."
"You're tougher than granite, I'll give you that."
"I'll build myself back up after this."

Burglar (Crook/Dark)
Before

"Oi, buzz off brat! I'm trying to sneaky here!"
"Don't do the crime if you can't take the time. Lucky I've got plenty of time on my hands!"
"Thank goodness nobody saw me, I might be in the clear… Wait a minute, where'd you come from?"
"You've got good timing... too bad for you it's bad luck."
"Looks like I've been caught in the act. Let's make this quick!"
After

"Guess I'll have to make a quick getaway."
"You got lucky this time. I'm outta here!"
"Alright, alright, I surrender… for now."
"Good thing I always have a backup plan!"
"You won the battle, but I'm still walking away with the loot!"

Bird Keeper (Flying)
Before

"The skies are where I dominate. You won't last long up here."
"Wings beat strength every time. Let me show you how."
"Let's see if you can keep up with my birds!"
"Up here, you're just a speck in the wind."
"Flying high is all I know. Are you ready to fall?"
After

"Grounded... for now. I'll soar again soon."
"I'll fly higher next time. Count on it!"
"Looks like I was blown off course today."
"A loss is just turbulence. I'll be back in the air soon."
"Guess you clipped my wings this time."

Black Belt (Fighting)
Before

"Strength is all that matters. Show me what you've got!"
"Every battle is a test of willpower. Let's see if yours breaks."
"I fight with honor, but I won't go easy on you."
"This is gonna hurt... but only for you."
"My fists are my words. Let's have a ‘conversation.'"
After

"You've earned my respect. For now."
"Even the strongest fall... but I'll rise again."
"A powerful opponent. I'll train harder for the next round."
"Defeated, but never broken."
"You hit hard, but next time, I'll hit harder."

Bug Catcher (Bug)
Before

"Bugs may be small, but they've got big power. Watch out!"
"Get ready to be swarmed!"
"You're about to find out why bugs rule the world!"
"You think you can squash my team? Think again!"
"These little guys pack a punch, don't underestimate them!"
After

"I guess I'll need to find some stronger bugs..."
"You're tougher than a Caterpie. I'll give you that."
"Looks like I need to evolve too..."
"Squashed me, huh? Next time, I'll sting harder!"
"I may have lost, but bugs always come back."

Picnicker (Bug/Grass)
Before

"A lovely day for a battle, isn't it? Let's make it interesting!"
"I packed a lunch, but you're about to get served!"
"Don't let my peaceful vibe fool you—I'll fight hard!"
"Let's enjoy the outdoors... before I take you down!"
"You think I'm just here to relax? I'll prove you wrong!"
After

"Well, that didn't go as planned. At least I've still got snacks!"
"I'll admit it, you've got me beat. Want a sandwich?"
"Looks like you're tougher than I thought. Good battle!"
"I guess I'll stick to picnics... for now."
"I lost, but at least I've got a great view!"

Student (M) (Normal)
Before

"Studying for battles? Pfft, I don't need to. Let's go!"
"I'll show you what I've learned outside the classroom!"
"Test time! And guess what—you're failing!"
"You might be the teacher's pet, but I'm no slouch!"
"This is one test you're not passing!"
After

"Okay, so maybe I do need to study more..."
"You win... I guess I'll hit the books after all."
"I failed the test... but I'll ace the next one!"
"That was tough. Maybe I'll ask you for tutoring?"
"I lost, but at least I'm still learning!"

Student (F) (Normal)
Before

"I always pass my tests, and I won't fail this battle!"
"Let's see if you've done your homework!"
"This is going to be an easy A for me."
"Ready for a pop quiz? Hope you're prepared!"
"Battles are like exams, and I'm always at the top of the class!"
After

"Guess I need to study harder next time..."
"You aced this one. I'll get you next time!"
"Ugh, a bad grade. I'm not used to this!"
"Well, I'll just have to do better on the final!"
"You passed this time. Next time, it's my turn to win."

Fisher (Water)
Before

"Fishing's all about patience... but I'm not waiting to win this!"
"You're about to be hooked by my strategy!"
"The water's calm, but I'm about to make some waves!"
"I've reeled in bigger fish than you. Let's do this!"
"You're on my line now, and I'm not letting go!"
After

"Looks like I'm the one who got caught this time."
"Well, back to fishing. Maybe I'll catch a win next time."
"You slipped away this time, but I'll reel you in eventually!"
"Guess I'll have to find a new spot to fish and train."
"Not my day, but the sea's full of second chances."

Surfer (M) (Water)
Before

"Dude, I'm about to ride the wave of victory!"
"The ocean's my playground, and you're about to get washed away!"
"You think you can handle the waves? Let's find out!"
"It's surf time! Let's hang ten... over your defeat!"
"I'm as smooth as the sea. Try to keep up!"
After

"Wiped out, huh? Well, that's the life of a surfer!"
"Guess I'll be hitting the waves instead of winning today."
"Good match! I'll train harder... between sets, of course."
"You've got skills, dude. Respect!"
"This wave knocked me down, but I'll catch the next one!"

Swimmer (F) (Water)
Before

"The water's my element, and you're about to get drowned out!"
"Let's see if you can keep afloat in this battle!"
"Ready to make a splash? I'll be the tidal wave that crashes you!"
"I'm fast in the water, and even faster in battle!"
"Hope you brought your swim gear, because I'm about to flood you out!"
After

"Looks like I sank this time. I'll swim harder next round!"
"You got the better of me... this time."
"Guess I'll need more laps to catch up to you."
"Good match! I'll see you back in the deep end!"
"I'm not going under just yet... next time, I'll win."

Explorer (Ice)
Before

"The cold never bothered me... but it's about to bother you!"
"I've scaled icy peaks, but this battle might be the real challenge."
"Hope you're not afraid of the cold—this battle's about to freeze you out!"
"I've seen harsh conditions, but you're about to face the frost of defeat."
"Prepare for an expedition into icy defeat!"
After

"Looks like I've hit a frozen patch... but I'll thaw out soon."
"Even explorers get lost sometimes. I'll find my way back."
"You're tougher than the frostbite I've faced... I respect that."
"I'll be better prepared for the next expedition."
"The cold got to me this time... but I'll warm up next time."

Gentleman (Any)
Before

"A fine battle calls for refinement and skill. Let's proceed with grace."
"A proper duel, wouldn't you say? Let's make this dignified."
"May the best trainer win, but rest assured, it will be me."
"Good form, good strategy—that's all it takes. Prepare yourself."
"Let's make this a fight to remember—one you'll never forget."
After

"Well played, my friend. A loss is but a lesson in disguise."
"You've bested me, and I commend you for it."
"You fought with honor. I respect that greatly."
"A defeat, yes, but hardly a disgrace. I'll return better."
"Splendid match. I look forward to our next encounter."

Lady (Any)
Before

"Don't expect me to go easy on you just because I'm refined."
"Elegance is key, but strength is where I shine."
"Let's keep this battle civilized, but make no mistake—I plan to win."
"You may think I'm all grace, but you'll soon learn otherwise."
"Prepare for a match of wit and power, darling."
After

"Well, I never! I suppose you've earned that victory."
"I've been bested, but you've gained my respect."
"A surprising result... but I won't dwell on it for long."
"You've won this round. Enjoy it while it lasts."
"I suppose I'll have to work on my strategy. Well done."

Maniac (Ghost)
Before

"I've seen things... dark, twisted things... You won't survive."
"The spirits whisper to me... They say you're next."
"Fear the shadows, for I command them. Prepare to tremble."
"I collect the macabre... and your defeat will be my latest addition."
"You're about to face your nightmares made real."
After

"The spirits... they were wrong this time... but they won't be forever."
"I've tasted defeat... but I'll rise again, like the restless dead."
"You survived this... but you won't be so lucky next time."
"Even in loss, I feel their presence... You'll face them again."
"I disappear... for now. But don't think this is over."

Magician (M) (Magic)
Before

"You're about to see a trick you'll never forget."
"I'll make your victory... disappear!"
"This battle is going to be magic. Too bad you're not prepared for it."
"Watch closely... or you'll miss the moment your chances vanish!"
"Prepare to be amazed... as I pull a win out of thin air!"
After

"Well, that wasn't part of the act... I'll need to work on my tricks."
"The magic didn't work this time, but next time, I'll be the master of illusions!"
"You're good... but I'll conjure a victory eventually."
"Looks like my sleight of hand wasn't enough this time."
"The show's not over yet... I'll be back with something better."

Magician (F) (Magic)
Before

"Welcome to the grand performance! Prepare to be dazzled!"
"Let's make your chances disappear in a puff of smoke!"
"I'm about to cast a spell... on your defeat!"
"A bit of illusion, a touch of flair... and a victory for me!"
"Let's see if you can keep up with my magical performance!"
After

"Oh dear, looks like I've lost the trick. I'll rehearse for next time!"
"You may have bested me, but magic is full of surprises."
"My illusions failed me, but I'll perfect them soon enough."
"I'll make sure this defeat disappears from memory."
"The show's not over yet... just you wait for the encore!"

Psychic (Psychic)
Before

"I foresaw this battle... and your loss."
"You cannot escape fate. It's already decided."
"Your thoughts are clear to me... and they're full of doubt."
"I'll bend your mind and your Pokémon to my will."
"Prepare yourself... I've already seen how this ends."
After

"Strange... I didn't foresee this outcome..."
"Your future is bright... but I'll be ready to change it next time."
"You've disrupted the flow of destiny... but I'll recalibrate."
"You've shown surprising strength... but the stars still favor me."
"It's just a temporary lapse in foresight... Next time, I'll win."

Astronomer (Galactic)
Before

"The stars guide my team. Let's see if you can handle their cosmic power."
"You're about to be eclipsed by the brilliance of the universe!"
"The galaxy is vast... and you're about to be lost in it."
"Prepare to face forces beyond your understanding."
"The stars align for my victory... not yours."
After

"The stars... must have misaligned this time."
"You've won this time, but the cosmos never stays the same for long."
"I'll recalibrate my strategy... and the stars will guide me to victory."
"You've navigated the stars well... but I'll see you again in the cosmos."
"The universe is vast, but next time, I'll show you the true power of the stars."

Youngster (Normal/Poison)
Before

"I'm young, but I'm ready to win! Let's do this!"
"You're gonna lose to me, just like everyone else!"
"Age doesn't matter—my Pokémon are tough!"
"I might be small, but my Pokémon pack a punch!"
"Ready for a lesson from someone younger than you?"
After

"No fair! You got lucky!"
"I guess I still have some growing to do..."
"You won this time, but I'm just getting started!"
"I'll get stronger, just you wait!"
"Next time, I'll wipe that smirk off your face!"
