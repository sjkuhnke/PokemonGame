Magic types and normal types have an interesting interaction because they're weak to each other (justify?)
Galactic types are really strong, but can get beat by the new light types as well as rock and flying

"You're good, but we're just getting started."
"Your victory means nothing in the grand scheme. Our plans remain intact."
"Fine, retreating for now. But know this, we don't stay down for long."
"You've only delayed the inevitable. We will succeed, with or without you."
"We'll remember this. The next time we meet, you won't be so fortunate."

Rick 3: Final Encounter (Mt. Splinkty)
Pre-battle:
"Back again, I see.
You’ve caused enough trouble already, but you’re too late. Everything is already in place.
Soon, all of Earth will bow before the power of Team Eclipse.
But before that... I think it’s time we settled this once and for all.
You may have beaten me once, but this time, I won’t hold back."

Post-battle:
"How...? How did you defeat me again?
It doesn’t matter. The machine is almost complete, and once it’s activated, everything will change.
You can’t stop what’s coming.
Enjoy your victory... while it lasts."

Fred 4: Team Eclipse Encounter (Mt. Splinkty Peak)
Pre-battle:
"So, you’ve made it all the way to the peak.
You’re persistent, I’ll give you that. But this is where it ends for you.
I’ve been working with Team Eclipse to create something powerful—something that will change everything.
I won’t let you stand in the way of our plans."

Post-battle:
"Damn it! No matter what I do, you always come out on top!
What am I even fighting for anymore...?
Maybe Rick was right. Maybe I’m not cut out for this.
But I can’t give up. I have to keep pushing forward, no matter what."

6. Rayna (Female, Light)
Thirties, independent, strong, beautiful

Pre-battle: "It’s been a while, hasn’t it?
I’ve been keeping an eye on you ever since you helped our town rebuild after that blackout. The people here haven’t forgotten what you did, and neither have I.
But this battle? It’s different. You’ll be facing the strength and purity of Light Pokémon, which means you’ll need more than just brute force to win.
Are you ready to shine? Let’s see if your light burns bright enough to stand against mine."

Post-battle: "Wow... You really outshone me today! I can’t believe how far you’ve come since we first met.
Your light—your strength—radiates in every battle.
Take this badge. You've more than earned it.
Remember, no matter how dark the path ahead might seem, your light will always guide you."

7. Merlin (Male, Magic)
Very old, grandfather to Arthra, magician, wise

Pre-battle: "Ah, I knew you’d come.
Arthra told me all about your encounter... about the battles you’ve fought and the victories you’ve earned.
But now, you face something different. Magic is not about what you see... but what you don’t.
Mystery, illusion, power beyond what you can comprehend—these are the tools I wield, and now you must face them.
Prepare yourself, young one, for this battle will be unlike any you’ve faced before."

Post-battle: "Ah... well done. You’ve seen through the illusion, found the truth, and prevailed.
Many challengers falter when they face the unknown, but you... you embraced it.
Take this badge. You’ve earned it through wit, skill, and perseverance.
Remember, though... magic is always around us, even when we cannot see it. Continue your journey with an open mind, and the answers will reveal themselves in time."

8. Nova (Female, Galactic)
Main antagonist's sidekick, lives in space, forties, strong and powerful

Pre-battle: "So, you finally made it. I’ve been waiting.
You’ve been meddling in our plans for too long. First, you disrupted our operations on Xhenos, then you interfered with our research on Ultra Paradox Pokémon.
You think you’re some kind of hero, don’t you? But out here, in the vastness of space, power is all that matters.
And now, you’ll see just how insignificant you really are. This isn’t like the battles you’ve faced before—this time, I’m not holding back."

Post-battle: "Impossible... how could you have beaten me?
No one has ever stood up to the Galactic force like that. You’re stronger than I gave you credit for, but don’t think this is over.
Take your badge, if it means that much to you.
But remember... this is just a small victory. The real battle is yet to come, and next time, you won’t be so lucky."
