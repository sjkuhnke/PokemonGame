Fisher (Water)
Before Battle:

""
""
"I've caught rare Pokemon in the deepest seas. You won't stand a chance!"
"Fishing takes patience, but when I strike, it's game over!"
"A fisherman never lets his prey escape. Let's see if you can!"
"The water's been kind to me, but I won't be kind to you!"
After Battle:

""
""
"You're one tough catch... Guess I need to reel it in."

"It's surf time! Let's hang ten... over your defeat!"
"I'm as smooth as the sea. Try to keep up!"
After

"Wiped out, huh? Well, that's the life of a surfer!"

"I'm fast in the water, and even faster in battle!"
"Hope you brought your swim gear, because I'm about to flood you out!"
After

"Looks like I sank this time. I'll swim harder next round!"
"You got the better of me... this time."
"Guess I'll need more laps to catch up to you."
"Good match! I'll see you back in the deep end!"

Lady (Any)
Before Battle:

""
"A little battle before tea? I suppose I can entertain you."
"Don't be fooled by my appearance. I have elegance and strength!"
"You look like you could use a good lesson in class... and battling!"
"Charming as you may be, my Pokemon are far superior!"
"You can't possibly think you'll beat me, can you?"
After Battle:

""
"Well, that was... unexpected. I shall reconsider my strategy."
"I suppose even the best of us lose sometimes..."

Maniac (Ghost)
Before Battle:

""
""
"Once you step into the shadows, you'll never escape!"

After Battle:

""
""

"You cannot resist the power of the mind. Let's see if you can survive!"
"The stars have aligned for this battle... But will they favor you?"
After Battle:

""
"Even psychics make mistakes... I underestimated you."
"You've altered the future, but I'll be back to correct it!"
"Hmph, perhaps my vision was clouded by arrogance."

After Battle
""
""
""
""
""
""
"You're good, but we're just getting started."
"Your victory means nothing in the grand scheme. Our plans remain intact."
"Fine, retreating for now. But know this, we don't stay down for long."
"You've only delayed the inevitable. We will succeed, with or without you."
"We'll remember this. The next time we meet, you won't be so fortunate."
