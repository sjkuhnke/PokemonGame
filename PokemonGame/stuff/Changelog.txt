Demo 1.0 Released

Changed the lv. 75 Snom in Possessed Trainer 3 to have Swarm instead of Icy Scales
**Added Shedinja to be obtainable in the standard way** (subject to change - extremely OP)
Shedinja will have random IVs and nature (to avoid bottle capping/minting Nincada is better than bottle capping Shedinja since it would be 2 for 1)
Gave Eclipse Grunt 15's (Wire Cutters guy) Weavile Chople Berry instead of None
Made Cage Critter appear on Trainer Docs
Made Kleine Village Gauntlet PC Disappear after beating Cage Critter
Added dialogue to the Wire Cutters grunt
Fixed Generating a Pokemon throw an error when trying to prompt you to nickname it
