Quality of Life
Add exp trainer in Schrice City
Add a nuzlocke check box when creating a new game

Implementation/Bug Fixes
Finish TMs (legendaries only)
Add more sashes to Gym 5/6 split
Test if Assault Vest in showdown actually blocks the move mid turn (i.e. getting Tricked/Encored)

Swap in text say "forced out"/"forced in" on random switch ins (Whirlwind etc)

Kissyfishy making out as a Ying-Yang thing
