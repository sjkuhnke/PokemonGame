TODO
Movesets:
Legendaries (TMs)

Polishing stuff
Make whirlpool spin (jk fuck that)
Make wild pokemon sometimes hold items (for balancing, can't covet bc it'll clear)
Lava Surf sprite tinted red, surf one tinted blue
Add PP to move info doc

Quality of Life
Add exp trainer in Schrice City
Add a nuzlocke check box when creating a new game
Make NPCs tell about old features being updated (deletable HMs, updated moves, etc)

Implementation/Bug Fixes
Finish TMs (legendaries only)
Add more sashes to Gym 5/6 split
Test if Assault Vest in showdown actually blocks the move mid turn (i.e. getting Tricked/Encored)
Encounters on R43 E over vine cross should be same as R43 W
Swap in text say "forced out"/"forced in" on random switch ins (Whirlwind etc)
Life Orb + Assault Vest behind optional trainer(s) in 5th gym split

Ideas
Make Dark resist Magic and Fighting no longer resist magic? (Would also make Galactic resist Dark again)
Make Bipedice Ice/Ground (not Ground/Ice) and redo moveset
Kissyfishy making out as a Ying-Yang thing

Calc
Get rid of enter press on level spinner, just make it an action listener

Make Galactic resist Dark
Make Galactic weak to Dragon
Make Magic weak to Dark

New Story
Add Klara and Fred's house to Sicab City

Fix Illusion working in calc (have it say true outside of battling actively)
Fix Trainer collision when interacting (can force 1v1s in back to backs if trainers are adjacent to the wall)
Fix Trainer collision above to be 15x15 or 16x16 (depending on above solution) and draw below trainers "above" (z axis) the player so the player can
walk "behind" the trainer
Change tile engine to have "below" and "above" tiles that some tiles render above the player (z axis)
Fix wild pokemon encounters and other task adding because even though you implicitly set the task state, the thread checks if the tasks are empty and will set it back to
play state "randomly"
