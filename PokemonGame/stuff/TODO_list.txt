Back side cave tiles, for Mindagan Cavern outside and Gelb Forest
Add PP to move info doc

Quality of Life
Add exp trainer in Schrice City
Add a nuzlocke check box when creating a new game

Implementation/Bug Fixes
Finish TMs (legendaries only)
Add more sashes to Gym 5/6 split
Test if Assault Vest in showdown actually blocks the move mid turn (i.e. getting Tricked/Encored)
Encounters on R43 E over vine cross should be same as R43 W
Swap in text say "forced out"/"forced in" on random switch ins (Whirlwind etc)
Make Baton Pass pass perish counter and electromag counter since they're not vStati

Ideas
Make Dark resist Magic and Fighting no longer resist magic? (Would also make Galactic resist Dark again)
Make Bipedice Ice/Ground (not Ground/Ice) and redo moveset
