Dear Finn,

I know it's been a long time since we've spoken, and for that, I'm sorry. I should have reached out sooner, but... well, I'm not going to make excuses. I'm sure you know by now that your father and I didn't exactly see eye to eye. His obsession with his research left little room for much else, including us. I wish things had been different, but I had to leave to find my own way. I just hope you understand that it was never about you.

But that's not why I'm writing now. It's about your grandpa. He hasn't been answering any of my messages, and I'm starting to worry. You know how stubborn he is - always insisting he's fine, even when he's not. But he's getting older, and living alone in Frenco City isn't exactly the safest situation for him anymore. I'm afraid something might have happened, and I can't bear the thought of him being in trouble and me doing nothing.

I know it's a lot to ask, especially after all this time, but could you go check on him? I wouldn't ask if it wasn't urgent. His house is in Frenco City, and I'm sure he'd be happy to see you. Please... do this for him, and for me.

Hoping our paths will cross some day, when the time is right.

Take care of yourself,

Astrid
