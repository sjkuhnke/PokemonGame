Dear Finn ,

Robin says you're in space .  Like actual outer space .  With oxygen concerns and physics and all .

I had to reread the letter three times and then walk in a circle .  I thought I hallucinated it .  I didn't .

I don't really know what a parent is supposed to say when their kid is up there trying to un-mind-control the planet .  But. . .   I'm proud of you .  And a little terrified .  But mostly proud .

When (not if) you get back, come by the lab .  I have something for you .  A gift .  Also, the water heater exploded again .  Probably because of Sember's relentless pacing .  Unrelated .  We're all worried about you here.

Be safe .  Trust your instincts .  And hope you didn't touch everything glowing .

Love ,
Dad

(P.S .  Bring the aqua-haired one if she's still with you .  She seems spunky . )
